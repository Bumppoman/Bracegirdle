          If the notice is given personally, by first class mail or by facsimile telecommunications or by electronic mail,
          it shall be given not less than ten nor more than fifty days before the date of the meeting;  if mailed by any other class
          of mail, it shall be given not less than thirty nor more than sixty days before such date.  If mailed, such notice is given
          when deposited in the United States mail, with postage thereon prepaid, directed to the member at his address as it appears
          on the record of members, or, if he shall have filed with the secretary of the corporation a written request that notices to
          him be mailed to some other address, then directed to him at such other address.  If sent by facsimile telecommunication or
          mailed electronically, such notice is given when directed to the member's fax number or electronic mail address as it appears
          on the record of members, or, to such fax number or other electronic mail address as filed with the secretary of the corporation.  
          Notwithstanding the foregoing, such notice shall not be deemed to have been given electronically (1) if the corporation is
          unable to deliver two consecutive notices to the member by facsimile telecommunication or electronic mail;  or (2)
          the corporation otherwise becomes aware that notice cannot be delivered to the member by facsimile telecommunication or
          electronic mail.  An affidavit of the secretary or other person giving the notice or of a transfer agent of the corporation
          that the notice required by this section has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts
          therein stated.  Whenever a corporation has more than five hundred members, the notice may be served by publication in a
          newspaper published in the county in the state in which the principal office of the corporation is located, once a week for
          three successive weeks next preceding the date of the meeting, provided that the corporation shall also prominently post
          notice of such meeting on the homepage of any website maintained by the corporation continuously from the date of publication
          through the date of the meeting.  A corporation shall send notice of meetings by first class mail to any member who requests
